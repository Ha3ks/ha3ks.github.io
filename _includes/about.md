My name is Dan, I am a Security Researcher and Ethical Hacker. This is my Website which chronicles my journey into CyberSecurity and all the fun adventures I have along the way.

This site is still a work in progress and I have a lot of work to do, I just wanted to get this up and running real quick.

A quick breakdown on my qualifications, I have a Certification in Practical Ethical Hacking, Windows Priv Esc and Linux Priv Esc from Udemy, an ICSI : Certified Network Security Specialist (CNSS), Ethical and Wireless Hacking certifications via StackSkills, Linux+ via Cybrary and a handful of other Cyber Security Certifications and Qualifications as well as years of experience in computing and more recently my focus in Cyber Security, oh and I maintain [this blog](https://github.com/ha3ks/ha3ks.github.io) as well.

In the mean time, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ha3ks), [GitHub](https://github.com/ha3ks) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/ha3ks).
