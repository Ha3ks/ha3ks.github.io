Hi, my name is Dan and welcome to my site. I am a CyberSecurity Professional, Security Researcher and Ethical Hacker. This is my personal Website which chronicles my journey into CyberSecurity as well as all the fun adventures I have along the way.

A quick breakdown on my qualifications and experience, I have Certifications in Practical Ethical Hacking, Windows Privilege Escalation and Linux Privilege Escalation from Udemy. ICSI : Certified Network Security Specialist (CNSS). Ethical Hacking, Wireless Hacking and Web Penetration Testing certifications via StackSkills. CompTIA Linux+, Network+ and Security+ Certifications via Cybrary and a handful of other CyberSecurity Certifications and Qualifications in addition to years of experience in computing and technical support, oh and I also maintain [this blog](https://github.com/ha3ks/ha3ks.github.io) as well.

In the mean time, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ha3ks), [GitHub](https://github.com/ha3ks) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/ha3ks).
