Long time no update, its been slowing down for me so I’m back on the coding wagon… todays lesson:

Bored.js

let favoriteAnimal = ‘dog’;
console.log(‘My favorite animal : ‘ + favoriteAnimal + ‘.’);

Yeh pretty much that… taking it slow and pickup up JavaScript for whatever reason,, this will likely burn out and ill move onto something else shortly.

Im in a slump and need to change.
