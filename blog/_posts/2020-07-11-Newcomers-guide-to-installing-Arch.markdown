<b>Objective:</b>
This guide will focus on a zero-knowledge base implementation and assumption that its readers have little to no experience with GNU/Linux software or Linux Distributions. In this guide users will learn how to correctly partition Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), protect the installed data with Full Disk Encryption (FDE) and install the rolling release distribution of Arch Linux, as well as other packages that will get the user up and running with a full graphical user interface and desktop environment.

<b>Getting started.</b>
Before you insert your install media you should have a general understanding of your computer Basic Input Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). In this guide we will cover the usage of a BIOS enabled machine.

<b>1. Booting Install Media</b>
Place your CD-ROM into the optical disk drive or insert your USB device into a USB port of your machine. Press the power button to start the machine and select the BIOS hotkey from your manufacturer that will allow you to choose what boot device to start from. Depending on which manufacture you have, your Boot Media selection options may vary (See images below for examples)
