This is the initial WordPress mandated blog post, nothing much to say at the moment however i’m going to be using this as my research dump (for lack of better words).

I’ve worked in IT for 20 years now so its time to start expelling things I have found or seen over the years as well as expand on some personal projects I have worked on/failed through/contributed too.

I have a feeling I am jumping on this bandwagon a little late but you never know…
