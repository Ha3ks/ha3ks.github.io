God I wish I could say my silence is in step with the old Backtrack Linux tag line.

No, my silence has been due to many forces deciding to come down on me like a ton of bricks.

I wont go into details as its all personal but lets say Depression and Anxiety.

I haven’t been making much progress in my learning which has bummed me out and I have also shifted to learning a new language, a language that everyone is paying top dollar for… C#

Fucking C#

Its no secret that since I started my current job I have been immediately looking for a way to get out of it, its a dead end job, no career progression, no further training, shite hours (almost entirely sure they are breaking some laws with this relating to rota and other things).

In my time looking for new jobs I have applied for say 200 jobs and only gotten 2 interviews, both didn’t pan out and one only because I didn’t ask many questions at the end of the interview.

This is an ass backwards way of doing things as your encouraged to learn all you can about a company before the interview, so when they put everything on their own website (memos and all) of course I am going to do what every self respecting pen-tester would do and go into RECON mode. The Jayson E Street way of doing things is spend no more then 2 hours on the company website –GREAT VIDEO, and if Jayson can pull off (in usually less then 2 hours) a full on Social Engineering Engagement then I sure as heck can learn enough to get the role but I digress.

The job websites that I am using all have a variety of options, roles searching etc (though I’m unsure why if I specify a 20 mile radius why jobs in Abu Dhabi turn up, someone should fix that) I have found that the vast majority are all looking for developers who have an experience in C# and are looking at paying 30k and upwards.

Now 30k may not seem like much, but to a dude who has made mistakes in the past its a god damn golden ticket.

So I’ve switched gears and I’m using Microsoft’s own training materials for learning C# (shout out to M ((OPSEC)) who twigged me onto this) and anyone else interested in this can use this link: https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=Lvld4EQIC_2706218949

Its again slow progress, seems familiar after my history with Visual Basic from Uni, hey maybe I can put that degree to use?

I wish I could update more and do more things online but I have now very little free time thanks to work and travel so I am going to keep this place as updated as possible and go from there.

On the personal note, the depression stuff. its harsh, brutal and can literally make you sick… but it is possible to get through it… it just doesn’t seem like it at the time ❤
